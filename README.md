this is yiqing's implementation of selective search algorithm
==============

one way to use it
--------------
is to run the **demo.m** file, and it will perform the selective search on single image

the other way to use it
---------------------
is to run the *testAllPicturesInDirectory.m* file and it will perform the selective search on
all the images in a directory, the result will also be written in the same directory


- the original algorithm is found in http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/juijling/#page=projects1
- but the original implementation in matlab is partially encrypted, so I implementation my own 

use the program like that in Matlab 
    demo
    testAllPicturesInDirectory
